# Backend
This repository showcases my backend development progress as I follow Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Complete Web Development Bootcamp. It includes projects and code covering Node.js, Express.js, EJS templating, REST APIs, routing, middleware, and more. Designed to build a strong foundation in backend and full-stack development.

ALL IN MASTER BRANCH!!!!
